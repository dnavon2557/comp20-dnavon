DESCRIPTION: A webpage that uses the <canvas> tag and javascript to display a 
duckhunt background with two birds
IMPLEMENTATION: The javascript uses the context from the canvas tag to draw the 
background and birds using drawImage. The script also waits for the images to 
finish loading before drawing them to the canvas using .EventListener. The 
images are cut out from a sprite sheet.
TIME SPENT: 1 hour to make the current file. Spent 3 hours trying to animate 
but gave up.
