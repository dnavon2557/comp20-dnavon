README
This repository contains code for assignments by Daniel Navon for the Web Programming Class (COMP 20) at Tufts University. While not all assignments work perfectly, the repo demonstrates the skills and progress made over the course of the semester. 
--My favorite assignment was the semester group project (intunewith.me) where me, Alex Spring, Lauren Dierker, and Alexandra Benbadis developed a webapp to play music based of the weather and location of the user. This project gave the fulfilling experience of working with a team who came from different skillsets and techinical backgrounds towards one final goal. The project we developed, while not perfect, works as we anticipated and provided a satisifying end to the semester.
--At day one of the course, I believed I had a decent amount of web experience. I was very very wrong. Now, looking back, I realize that I actually understood very little about how the web works or how websites are developed. The final project is something I never would have been able to eachive with the skillset I had at the beginning of the course. The course didn't just teach me node or javascript, however, I also learned how work on a long term project with a team, how to find solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems, and other applicable real world skills. 
--In addition to the real world skills taught by the course, I learned how to (almost) properly use Git, as well as how to exit vim (it's :wq). In reality though, the most important skill learned in the course was finding solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems. Throughout this course I learned how to read documentation, such as the Bootstrap Docs, to find solutions to problems, how to analyze code examples to come up with my own implementation, such as for the spotify web player used in the final project, and how to solve a bug that won't go awayn by having your team look at the problem together.
--Having finished the course, I would really enjoy devlving deeper into the backend of the web. Creating APIs, while incredibley frustrating at times, was a very interesting and reqarding process.
